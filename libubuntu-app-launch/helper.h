/** Class representing an untrusted helper in the system.  Untrusted
    helpers are used by trusted helpers to get some amount of functionality
    from a package in the system. Typically this is via a Click hook
    in a Click package.

    In order to setup a untrusted helper the trusted helper needs to
    install a small executable that gives the equivallent of a Desktop
    Exec string to the system. This is done by installing the executable
    in the ``/usr/lib/$(arch)/ubuntu-app-launch/$(helper type)/exec-tool``.
    A simple example can be seen in [URL Dispatcher's URL Overlay
   helper](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~indicator-applet-developers/url-dispatcher/trunk.15.10/view/head:/service/url-overlay.c).
    It is important to note that the helper will be confined with the apparmor
    profile associated with the AppID that is being used. For Click based
    applications this means that an untrusted helper should be its own
    stanza in the Click manifest with its own ``apparmor`` hook. This will
    configure the confinement for the helper.

    Many times an untrusted helper runs in a non-user-facing mode, it is
    important that UAL **DOES NOT** implement a lifecycle for the helper. It
    is the responsibility of the trusted helper to do that. Many times this
    is a timeout or other similar functionality. These are the tools to
    implement those in a reasonable fashion (services don't have to worry
    about AppArmor, cgroups, or jobs) but it doesn't not implement them
    by itself.
