  [ Ken VanDine ]
  * Multi-Arch: same libraries must not depend on run-time application,.
    since this breaks cross-compilation. Furthermore, circular
    dependencies are never needed: upstart-app-launch depends on
    libupstart-app-launch2, which depends on upstart-app-launch. It's
    the same reasoning why we do not make libgtk-3.0 depend on epiphany
    webbrowser, even though gtk has functions to open URL in a
    webbrowser. And in a multi-arch world libgtk-3.0 would never know
    which architecture your web-browser is, it could be any. Libraries
    should only ever depend on other linked shared libraries.

  [ Ricardo Mendoza ]
  * Currently we are signalling observers that app started on the
    "starting" signal. This is racy, as the final exec might not have
    happened yet, so if a client tries to get the primary PID before the
    process has fully started, it might get one of the transitional PIDs
    of the scripts that run in between.
